REQUIREMENT
========================================================================
Three packages are required:
- PIL
- libspatialindex
- Rtree

PIL can be downloaded from http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz.
Please follow the installation guide carefully (remember to install 
libjpeg first according to the guide).

libspatialindex and Rtree is located at */experiment1/libs/*, due to 
modification has been made. To install these two libraries, please follow 
the installation instruction inside the package.


USAGE
========================================================================

*ImageFeatureExtractorV1.py* and *ImageFeatureExtractorV2.py* are 
implementations of two different approaches of color histogram features. 
To use these two programs, you need to put them in the parent directory 
of *image*. Then excuting *python ImageFeatureExtractorVx.py*, the files 
like *color_feature_4.txt*, *imagelist_8.txt* will be generated. The 
format of these files is identical to the format of files provided by 
the project.

*Queries.py* is used to generate the number of node access with respect 
to the various number of features and the number of data objects inserted. 
It also generates the correctness rate, which is defined in section 2.3 
in the report. You need to put this file in the same directory as the 
first two files.

After excuting *python Queries.py queries*, files *problem1* and *problem2* 
will be generated. These files contain the number of node access. The first 
column is the number of objects inserted to the index. The next columns 
contain the number of node access with respect to various dimension of 
features. In *problem1*, the dimensions are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 27 and 64. 
In *problem2*, we used the features provided by the project, thus the 
dimension is 9.

It is also available to execute *python Queries.py relevance*. The file 
*problem3* will be generated, which contains the correctness rate. Each line 
contains ten rate with respect to the 10, 20, ..., 100 nearest neighbors. 
The eight lines are with respect to 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 27, 64 and 9 dimension 
of features.

*Main.py* is a program that provided an interface for querying by example. It 
provides two ways to query related images. One is to query some images (the 
number of results can be specified) to a given image, the other is to query 
images related to given images listed in a file. Before excuting the program, 
you need to put this file in the parent directory of *image* together with 
file *ImageFeatureExtractor.py* (which means that you need to rename the 
first two files). You can type "python Main.py --help" to get the
instructions of this program.
